# Responsive Quiz homework4
For this project, we are creating a timed responsive quiz. When you click the start button, a question will render on the screen with buttons as your options. Select the right answer and move on, but if you select the wrong answer your time will be penalized. When you make it through the quiz, a highscore page will display where you can enter your initials and save your score.

# Why?
A quiz is a fun way to test your knowledge and we want to learn about coding!


# The Process
I started with the basics of the HTML and styled it with Bootstrap CSS/custom styling. Then with JavaScript, we write an object variable consisting of arrays of questions and answers. Afterwards, I made the timer starting at 60 seconds and ticking down. We then add an eventListener to check to see if we click the start button. After that, we make a series of functions and methods to display the questions and selectable answers. Then create conditionals, moving on for correct answers and penalizing wrong ones. Once that is done, make a form where we can input our initials and record our score. Then you tie it to the user's local storage.
